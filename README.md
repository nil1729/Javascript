# Weather App #

### About Weather App ###

* This weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18Â°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country (Delhi, IN). When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

* The icons I used for this web application are created by the Graphic Designer [Ashley Jager](https://github.com/manifestinteractive/weather-underground-icons).

* The API provider is [Open Weather Map](http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org).

# To Do List App #

Visit [here](https://nil1729.github.io/Javascript/To-Do-List/) to see how it Works.

### About To Do List ###

* In this App, I use vanilla Javascript to create a beautiful and functional **To Do List**

* This To Do List has a beautiful UI, the user can add a To-Do by filling the input and hit ENTER or PLUS after that he can rather check the To-Do when it's done, or remove it using the delete button.

* The user's to-do list is stored in the local storage, so when he refreshes the page, he can always find the list there.

* There is the possibility for the user, to clear the list, by clicking the button clear, at the top right corner of our app.

* The to do list app, shows the today's date to the user, for that I used a method called **toLocaleDateString**
