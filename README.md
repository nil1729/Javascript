### About Weather App ###

* This weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18Â°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country (Delhi, IN). When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

* The icons I used for this web application are created by the Graphic Designer [Ashley Jager](https://github.com/manifestinteractive/weather-underground-icons).

* The API provider is [Open Weather Map](http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org).
